Gamemaker Games
==============

some old class projects made with gamemaker. I will sort these as soon as I can get them loaded correclty into 
GameMaker Studio. These were made using GameMaker 7, and it is quite likely that they will never work properly 
in the current version.

There are four games present:
Frogger: High School
Fat Cat: Basically pac man with mice and cats
Space Invaders: Color Matching
Grand Theft Auto: Pre-School Edition

None of these were made with proper version control, and all of them were group projects. The result is the 
insane naming scheeme you see here. We all learned our lesson and were absolutely thrilled to start using Github.
Several of the files are not complete game files but were partial projects containing just sprites, or a level, 
which were then merged to create the final game. I am looking into a nice way to store the few executables I 
found without filling this repository.
